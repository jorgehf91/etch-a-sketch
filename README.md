There are still one suggested feature to add: darken the color of the "brush" with each passing of the mouse. 
And more importantly, nail the CSS to:

- center the grid
- implement CSS grid or Flexbox to make it a truly flexible project
- and maintain the grid's size constant independently of the cells number.

But so far is more than a passable solution to the lesson's challenge.
